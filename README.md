## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

One of the things that I learned during this project was the transform property that I used to get the outer white frame to center vertically. 
The CSS wasn't super impressive as it mainly consisted of font properties and margins. 

### Continued development

The area that I hope to develop through these challenges are my JavaScript skills. I've just started learning Frontend Development, and I'm looking for a way to apply
the small amount of JS that I've learned.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - This helped me with the trasnform property. It has a cool visual that users can change to see the effect.
