## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Some of the things that I learned during this project are as follows:

```css
.implementation-of-fonts {
   font-family: 'myFirstFont';
    src: url('HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf'); /*This is the first time that I've used variable fonts in a site page*/
}
```

```css
.use-of-gradients {
  background-image: linear-gradient(hsl(224, 30%, 27%),hsl(224, 30%, 27%)); /*Starting to understand how to use linear gradients. Just need to implement them with angles*/
}

```


### Continued development

Something that I used from a site was the display table property. I would like to learn more about when it is a good idea to use this property. Another property tht I hope to learn more about is the linear-gradient property. I have yet to implement this property with an angle.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12645366/css-responsive-center-div) - This helped me with centering the main div. I ended up going with the auto margins + display table option.
- [Unused CSS](https://unused-css.com/blog/css-half-circle/) - This site really helped when it came to getting those half circles on the sides (I kept getting an oval on my own).
